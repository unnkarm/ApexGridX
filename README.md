## 🏎️ What is ApexGrid?

ApexGrid is a startup-grade F1 analytics and community platform combining:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🗺️ **Race Replay** | Animated SVG track map, DRS zones, live car positions |
| 📊 **Tyre Strategy** | Bayesian degradation model for compound analysis |
| ⏱️ **Telemetry** | Speed traces, gear, DRS, brake data per driver |
| 🤖 **GridBot AI** | Claude-powered race strategy assistant |
| 👥 **Community** | Posts, team rooms, reactions, prediction league |
| 📋 **Race Timeline** | Lap-by-lap event visualization with hover details |

## 🗺️ Dashboard Features

### Track Replay
- Animated SVG circuit with real car positions (VER, NOR, LEC, RUS)
- **DRS zones** highlighted in green (toggle with D key — from f1-race-replay)
- Start/finish line, corner labels
- Playback: play/pause, 0.5x–8x speed, scrub bar with event markers
- Safety Car / Yellow Flag status overlays

### Tyre Strategy Visualizer
Powered by `bayesian_tyre_model.py` — a Kalman filter state-space model:
- Compound stint bars (S/M/H/I/W) with degradation indicator
- Degradation percentage shown at bottom of each bar (green → amber → red)
- Pit window recommendations based on remaining tyre life
- Compound suggestions for undercut/overcut windows

### Race Timeline
From `extract_race_events()` in the original race-replay source:
- Interactive hover timeline at lap precision
- Typed events: Safety Car 🚨, Pit 🔧, Overtake ⚡, DRS 💨, Fastest Lap ⏱️
- Color-coded by event type

### Live Leaderboard
- Gap to leader + interval gap
- Tyre compound dot (color-coded)
- DRS active badge
- Click to select driver for telemetry view

### Weather Panel
From `WeatherComponent` in original source:
- Air temperature, track temperature, humidity, wind direction

## 🤖 GridBot AI

GridBot is powered by **Claude Sonnet** via Anthropic API.

**Capabilities:**
- Race strategy analysis ("Why did Ferrari lose Bahrain?")
- Concept explanations ("What is an undercut?")
- Driver comparisons ("VER vs NOR pace comparison")
- Race outcome predictions
- Pit window recommendations (backed by Bayesian model)
- Community sentiment summarization

**Quick questions:** pre-loaded chips for common F1 questions.
